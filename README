lkup Record R2-0-0 Release Notice
================================================================================

The look-up table record software in this release is developed to support two
way look-ups, with interpolation, between the X and Y variables of a strictly
increasing or decreasing curve.  It is compatible with EPICS base R3-14-12.

It has the following main fields:

INP     inlink              R      input link to read back X
OUT     outlink             R      output link to drive X
VAL     double              R/W    desired value of Y
RBV     double              R      read back value of Y
LVAL    char[40]            R/W    desired label on Y
LRBV    char[40]            R      read back label on Y
NMAX    integer             R      max no of data points
NPTS    integer             R/W    no of data points
XVAL    double[NMAX]        R/W    array of X values
YVAL    double[NMAX]        R/W    array of Y values
LABL    char  [NMAX][40]    R/W    array of labels
DVAL    double[NMAX]        R/W    delta on X values (for labeling)
INIT    integer             R/W    set to "0" when changing NPTS, X/Y/DVAL, LABL
                                   set to "1" when done changing

An example use case is with a zoom lens, where INP is the RBV field of the zoom
motor, OUT is the VAL field of the motor, XVAL is an array of motor positions,
YVAL is the corresponding measured zoom factors, while the optional DVAL and
LABL are arrays of labels for convenience/quick access.
